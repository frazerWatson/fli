<p>This blog was started as a personal motivation to go explore, discover and share interesting and fun locations to skate. I try to skate everyday and want to session as many different places as possible. Even though I havenâ€™t been skating for very long, it has quickly become one of the most important obsessions in my life, to which I dedicate a great deal of time, energy and suffering. One of my main ambitions in life is to be in a position where I can put more of my time and effort into my skating, and so I started this blog as a personal obligation to push myself to skate more and more everyday.</p>
